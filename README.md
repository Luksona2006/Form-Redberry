# This is redberry's task for bootcamp :)
## How it works
#### User enters data in required fields (need to pass validations), right of form all data will be displayied, after all steps will be created cv, that u will see on display
## Things that I added by myself
#### I added (it was my idea) a delete button to remove the last added form, if the user changes their mind about adding adittional experience or education, user simply deletes the last added form. I think it's more practical and comfortable, so I hope this decision doesn't change the Redberry staff's opinion about my work (in a bad way).
#### File receiving/File processing, Checking file format (choosing image), if it's png/jpg/jpeg than accept it, else doesn't (corresponding texts)
#### Data recieving/Data processing/Cv formating animation after submitting education form (last step)
## How I had done this
#### I didn't have done this kind of form before, I mean that, forms that I usually was making were simple. It took me 3-4 days to finish this project (without animations that I added)
